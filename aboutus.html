                    <p class="additional-info">Zach is a lazy bum who will never come to work on time. He is my worst worker but I still keep him around because he only cost $50 per hour. Zach not only shows up to work 40 minutes late but is also lazy and will take smoke breaks in the middle of the shift. When it comes to doing work, which is restocking, he will always leave the half empty boxes in the middle of the store, showing how uncapable and lazy he is.</p>
