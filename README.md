# Assignment-1
For my FED assignment, I have made a website inspired by Caseoh's TCG Card Simulator walkthrough. In the game, you own a card shop. To progress further on, you have to sell more and more products to other customers. 

In this website, I have made a place where people can buy the products online without having to go into the store. This website features a cart and checkout feature so that customers can order their items. It sells a variety of cards and other products that helps with the customers card collection. 

I have also implemented a "Contact Us" page in the event where the customers have any questions about the products we have in stock. Lastly, the "About Us" page is for customers and other users to get to know more about the employees here. 

I have chosen this pallate of colours as I believe that it suits the colour of the store the most
